## Milestones

### Core

1. Finalize data selection.

2. Join separate data sources into one CSV.

3. Create a frontend survey-like page where we will get users to answer questions about their coffee bean preferences.

4. Create a simple survey to collect initial data from our class to get a sample of coffee bean preferences.

5. Preference data can be matched with data from Bottomless, and an exploratory data analysis of the preferences can be created to show trends in our subset of the population.

6. Determine the variables we will be using to select a particular brand (and subbrand) of coffee. For our initial MVP, we will do a simple match of coffee preferences for the selected variables to a list of coffee with those attributes.

7. Create a pipeline that will connect data collected in the frontend (Step 3) and then query our data table. Each time a user enters the coffee questions, they will receive a list of coffee that match their preference.

8. In the final output, also show whether that selected coffee is sold in a local supermarket or the roaster's own retail outlet. Also, display online buying options.

### Stretch Goals

1. Scrape more coffee data in Washington State and beyond.

2. Find location data of coffee products sold from Instacart and additional supermarkets.

3. Scrutinize company registration to make sure they are truly registered in the state of Washington.

4. Use more complex statistical analysis to give a percentage match of a particular coffee, so users know how close they are to matching the coffee bean.
