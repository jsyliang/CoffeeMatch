## Coffee Match – Washington Local Coffee Recommendation System

1. Alex and Kim recently moved to Seattle and they want to gain introduction to a local roasted coffee bean that suits their liking. They’re willing to answer preferential questions in exchange for being matched with the “right” local roaster. They need to learn some qualitative and quantitative aspects during the process to have confidence in the resulting match. They’re app savvy and online.

2. Chris has been changing their normal breakfast routine and wanted to support local businesses at the farmer’s market etc. Chris wants to have some coffees in mind for next Sunday when the market occurs or they visit cafes with friends. One of the reasons Chris attends the farmers market is for the great variety so they appreciate a tool that provides a few different matches and ideas for cafe meeting spots. They appreciate the novelty of exploring new options. They might even want to follow up on the app while they are at the market to ensure the coffees that they see are the ones they are seeking. They are non-technical and would appreciate the simple interface.

3. Sitka Roasters would like to add their roaster and respective coffees to the CoffeeMatch database to improve their client exposure. They are seeking an unbiased platform for their nascent offering – three roasts performed in a cast iron skillet – to online customers. Due to their old fashion method, batch consistency varies more than most roasteries, and they’ve been plagued by some bad reviews. Although they are familiar with social media, they’re not database savvy and would prefer to email required variables to the CoffeeMatch Admin. Their main hope is to gain some additional volume and positive reviews from the app.

In addition to gaining wider exposure for their product, Stitka looks forward to following up with CoffeeMatch to see how - and perhaps why - users are interacting - or not - with their presence on the application.
